This section captures the basic ways in which a user would want to participate in the Ethereum project.  First, in order to become a node in the Ethereum network you must run an Ethereum client.  Multiple implementations are listed in the :ref:`sec:clients` section along with advice on which client to choose for various setups.  In :ref:`sec:connecting-to-the-network`, new users can find basic information about networks, connectivity, troubleshooting and blockchain synchronization. Advanced network topics such as setting up private chains are found in :ref:`test-networks`.
